This is my course project on Design of fail-safe distributed information systems course. My goal was to implement DB architecture, CRUD Controlles for models and Administrator's panel. You can run this project in Visual Studio 2017 or later with preinstalled ASP.NET Core and C# 7.2 (you also need local or remote MSSQL Server).
